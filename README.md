The PengCub-Gym-Managment-Tool is an online application that fuctions as a scheduling and personel managment tool for a fake gym I created, the PengCub Gym.  The tool allows asdministrators the ability to manage gym members, instructors and classes.  Exercise classes, members, and instructors can be both added and removed at the administrators discretion.  Once an exercise class is scheduled for a particular date and time, the administrator can register members for said class.  Triggers and foreign keys in the back-end ensure room capacities are not exceeded, instructors cannot teach more than one class at once, members cannot attend more thatn one class at once, and rooms cannot be scheduled for more than once class at once.The front end was written in PHP and the backend in MYSQL.  I used Heroku to host the site with JawsDB as the database add on.
